        <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine recently created a chatbot for his Discord server, and he asked if I could host it for him. He didn&amp;rsquo;t want to leave his PC running 24/7, and he knows I enjoy tinkering with Linux servers. Join me as I set up a cozy little home for the Discord bot I adopted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I use a lot of free and open-source software‚Äîlike MarkText, which I&amp;rsquo;m using to write this article‚Äîand I deeply appreciate the effort developers put into these passion projects. Most of the programs I use already do everything I need, so I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to contribute code back to any of them. But that changed recently when I found the perfect feature to add to Raivo OTP!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I began orthodontic treatment recently, and having a digital CBCT scan was part of the consultation process. As a former radiography student with an interest in data processing, I really wanted to get my hands on a copy of the scan so I could conduct some experiments. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what I was able to do with it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Making sprite sheets has never been easier: toss a folder at my new program and watch magic happen! This blogpost details both why and how I created a new tool to solve a common obstacle in low-level game development. EzSpriteSheet was a month-long commitment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Crafting simple hardware drivers with libusb</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently upgraded my computer mouse. Windows drivers are available through the vendor&amp;rsquo;s website, but what&amp;rsquo;s a daily Linux user like me to do? Reverse engineer it, of course!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I write a lot of software, and last week I decided to spice up my repertoire with something fun: why not a video game? I spent only three days on this one, and I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with how it turned out. In this article, I describe the steps I took to complete a small game development project: from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever go on a treasure hunt? Think of that, except the entire adventure takes place inside a blob of data no one has ever laid eyes on. We data miners are digital archaeologists, and we struck a goldmine. Today, I will tell the tale of the F-Zero X overdump expedition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are able to do most of our Nintendo 64 development in C nowadays. But things weren&amp;rsquo;t always like that! Long ago, legendary hackers did it all in handwritten assembly. Join me as I write a minimalistic MIPS assembler/disassembler and show you how to compile a rudimentary hack using it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;These wild berries are growing in my backyard. What can I say? I really like berries. üçì&lt;/p&gt;</description>
